# Iris-Classification
This repository contains a simple web application built with Flask and Jinja templates. It uses the Iris dataset and leverages Pandas and NumPy for data handling, while scikit-learn is employed to create a classification model. The model predicts the species of Iris flowers based on sepal and petal measurements.
