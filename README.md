# Iris-Classification
This repository contains a simple web application built with Flask and Jinja templates. It uses the Iris dataset and leverages Pandas and NumPy for data handling, while scikit-learn is employed to create a classification model. The model predicts the species of Iris flowers.



This repository contains a Flask-based web application that demonstrates a classification model using the Iris dataset. The model predicts the species of Iris flowers.

## Technologies Used

- Jinja2: Used for rendering HTML templates.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- NumPy: Used for numerical operations.
- scikit-learn: Utilized to create and deploy the classification model.


Directory Structure
